# Cafe-MenuBoard
a simple cafe menuboard that displays several menus and scrolling food pictures

coded in C++ using Windows.h and D2D1.h (direct2D)

the cafe this was made for is now closed, so its free for anyone to use or fork.
all i ask is that if you make a good/novel change, bring it back here.
