The menu board is automatic and will load images placed in either the "PicturesMenu" or the "PicturesFood" folders.

images placed in the "PicturesFood" folder will scroll along the right hand side of the screen.

images placed in the "PicturesMenu" folder will be displayed, one at a time, on the left half of the screen.

For best results, make sure the images in "PicturesMenu" are taller than they are wide.

Be advised that the order the files are loaded may not be alphabetical.
